        <p>Do you know someone who has had breast cancer?</p>
        <p>Those who’ve gone through breast cancer treatment need extra support from their friends, their family - and their bra.</p>
        <p>Every woman deserves to feel beautiful. We have collaborated with Doctors, Surgeons and Nurses to produce a line of bras with patients’ needs at the forefront of the design.</p>
        <p>Love Me (And My Secret), bringing you comfort, style and a little bit of sexy even the fashionable would be proud of. </p>
